## LLM Agents - Part 3: **<a href="https://aisc.substack.com/p/llm-agents-part-3-multi-agent-llm">Design Patterns</a>**

Going to the basics of RL is important in thinking through agentic workflows, as we discussed before. Also going back to software design principles is the way to go about creating multi-agent systems. Let's discuss how the below established software design principles can be applied to the emerging trend of multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems:
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD), 
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and 
- Microservices architecture

Traditional design patterns provide a robust framework for software development. By integrating machine learning (ML) into these patterns, we can introduce a new dimension to software architecture. ML enables **probabilistic routing** between software components, replacing **pre-programmed deterministic routing**. This integration not only enhances the functionality of individual components but also introduces new capabilities. Both LLMs and specialized ML models, and often a combination of the two, can be utilized to achieve these improvements.

### Communication methods

Communication methods between components, previously services and more recently agents, remain consistent with traditional approaches, using 
- REST, 
- GraphQL, 
- JSON, and 
- DSLs. 

However, the introduction of natural language as an interface adds a new layer of complexity, with its own set of advantages and challenges. These hybrid systems, combining predetermined and probabilistic behavior, may become the new standard in software development.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

DDD emphasizes modeling software around the **core domain of a business**. It advocates for a common language shared by developers and domain experts, ensuring everyone speaks the same language. DDD breaks down the domain into bounded contexts, areas with well-defined and segregated responsibilities, and often minimal dependency on other areas.

Bounded contexts ensure that complexity is manageable by focusing on specific aspects of the domain. This focus also promotes better communication and understanding between developers and domain experts. **By breaking down the domain into bounded contexts, we lay the groundwork for introducing agents with specialized capabilities, each responsible for a specific bounded context within the larger multi-agent LLM system**. Just as bounded contexts promote modularity and focus within the domain, agents with bounded responsibility will do the same.

Each bounded context has its own data entities, business rules, and common language. This modular approach allows developers to focus on specific areas of functionality without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire system.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

SOA takes the concept of bounded contexts from DDD and maps them to services. Each service encapsulates a specific domain functionality and exposes a well-defined interface. This promotes loose coupling, allowing services to evolve independently without impacting others.

### Microservices architecture

Microservices architecture takes SOA a step further by creating even smaller, more focused services. Unlike SOA, in microservice architectures the services focus as narrowly as possible, often only on a single function. This approach offers greater agility, scalability, and resilience. Each microservice owns its data and logic, promoting independent development and deployment.

**You might notice that some of the things that you’ve imagined as “multi-agent” systems could be achieved simply by a well designed software system.**

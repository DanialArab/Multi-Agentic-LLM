## LLM Agents - Part 3: Design Patterns

Going to the basics of RL is important in thinking through agentic workflows, as we discussed before. Also going back to software design principles is the way to go about creating multi-agent systems. Let's discuss how the below established software design principles can be applied to the emerging trend of multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems:
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD), 
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and 
- microservices architecture

Traditional design patterns provide a robust framework for software development. By integrating machine learning (ML) into these patterns, we can introduce a new dimension to software architecture. ML enables **probabilistic routing** between software components, replacing **pre-programmed deterministic routing**. This integration not only enhances the functionality of individual components but also introduces new capabilities. Both LLMs and specialized ML models, and often a combination of the two, can be utilized to achieve these improvements.

### Communication methods

Communication methods between components, previously services and more recently agents, remain consistent with traditional approaches, using 
- REST, 
- GraphQL, 
- JSON, and 
- DSLs. 

However, the introduction of natural language as an interface adds a new layer of complexity, with its own set of advantages and challenges. These hybrid systems, combining predetermined and probabilistic behavior, may become the new standard in software development.

LLM Agents - Part 3: Design Patterns

Going to the basics of RL is important in thinking through agentic workflows, as we discussed before. Also going back to software design principles is the way to go about creating multi-agent systems. Let's discuss how the below established software design principles can be applied to the emerging trend of multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems:
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD), 
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and 
- microservices architecture

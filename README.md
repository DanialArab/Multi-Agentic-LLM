Here is the summary of my notes from Deep Random Thoughts by Amir Feizpour:
- LLM Agents: An Intelligent Agent (IA) is an autonomous, meaning that the agent operates independently without requiring direct human intervention for its decision-making or actions, entity that observes and acts upon an environment to achieve specific goals. most IAs possess some or all of the following key properties:
  - Autonomous operations
  - Reactive to the environment
  - Proactive (goal-directed)
  - Interactive with other agents (via the environment)

Here is the summary of my notes from Deep Random Thoughts by Amir Feizpour (https://aisc.substack.com/p/llm-agents-part-2-what-the-heck-are):
- LLM Agents: An Intelligent Agent (IA) is an autonomous, meaning that the agent operates independently without requiring direct human intervention for its decision-making or actions, entity that observes and acts upon an environment to achieve specific goals. most IAs possess some or all of the following key properties:
  - Autonomous operations
  - Reactive to the environment
  - Proactive (goal-directed)
  - Interactive with other agents (via the environment)
- Do I need multi-agentic LLM: Yes, if:
    - Your task is more complex and involves multiple steps.
    - Needs the ability to remember past interactions and context.
    - Benefits from accessing and interacting with external tools or resources.
    - Requires a level of autonomy in completing the task.
    
    Examples:
  
    - A virtual assistant that manages your schedule, checks weather data, and books appointments.
    - A system that analyzes customer reviews and recommends product improvements.
    - A chatbot that can answer complex questions by searching the web and integrating information from different sources.
    - A content creation tool that understands your previous creative decisions and generates content that aligns with your overall vision.
